# Payment Integration System â€“ Booking.com

This repository outlines the high-level architecture for a robust, scalable, and vendor-agnostic **Payment Integration System** for a global platform like Booking.com. It supports diverse payment flows (e.g., partial and full credit card payments) across multiple payment service providers (PSPs).

---

## ðŸš€ Functional Requirements (FRs)

1. **Common Interface** to integrate multiple payment vendors.
2. **Flexible Payment Flows** â€“ 20% now, 80% later; 100% upfront, etc.
3. **Feature Flags** for toggling payment modes in case of vendor failure.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **High Reliability & ACID Consistency**
- **Efficient Load Balancing** and Vendor Failover
- **Circuit Breaking & Exponential Backoff Retries**
- **Graceful Degradation & Monitoring**
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**
- **Periodic Archival for Compliance**

---

## ðŸ§± System Components

- **Payment Service**: Orchestrates payment requests, routes to vendors.
- **Common Interface**: Abstracts vendor-specific logic, enables round-robin or adaptive routing.
- **Queue (SQS/Kafka)**: Manages async retries and dead-letter queues (DLQs).
- **Vendors (PSPs)**: Integrated payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Adyen).
- **Payments DB**: Stores ACID-compliant records, sharded by geography & userId.
- **Archiver + ETL**: Periodically fetches and dumps cold data to blob storage.

---

## ðŸ§ª Scale Considerations

- **100M users**
- **10M+ payments/day (~1GB/day)**
- **2TB storage over 5 years**
- **DB Choices**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for sharding support)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Future Enhancements

- Idempotency keys and deduplication
- Vendor health scoring & adaptive routing
- AuthN/AuthZ integration
- PCI-DSS compliance (encryption, tokenization)
- Payment orchestration via Temporal/Cadence
