# Ecommerce Flash Sale

### **Overview**
This system is designed to handle large-scale e-commerce flash sales, such as Black Friday events, where millions of users attempt to purchase limited inventory simultaneously. The goal is to ensure system reliability, prevent over-selling, and maintain a seamless user experience under extreme load conditions.

---

### **Key Challenges**
1. **Prevent Over-Selling**: Ensure inventory accuracy across multiple nodes.
2. **Efficient Queue Management**: Prevent system overload during high traffic.
3. **Database Burst Handling**: Handle millions of concurrent read/write operations.

---

### **Architecture Components**

1. **Distributed Lock System**: 
   - **Redis (Redlock)** or **Zookeeper** to prevent over-selling.
   
2. **Database Optimization**:
   - **Sharded PostgreSQL** for high write throughput.
   - **Read replicas** for handling massive read traffic.
   - **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** to ensure durability.

3. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for queueing orders and reducing load on the main system.
   - **Eventual Consistency** for non-critical updates (e.g., emails, analytics).

4. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Multi-layer caching using **CDN** and **Redis** for frequently accessed data.
   - Implement **cache invalidation** for inventory changes.

5. **Load Balancing & Traffic Control**:
   - **NGINX** or **HAProxy** for load balancing.
   - **Circuit Breakers** (e.g., Resilience4j) to prevent cascading failures.
   - **Rate Limiting** to control traffic spikes.

6. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring.
   - Set up alerts for latency, error rates, and resource utilization.

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
1. **High Consistency**: Strong consistency for inventory to prevent over-selling.
2. **Low Latency**: System response time <2 seconds.
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Serve static content or fallback pages during extreme load.
4. **Reliability & Failover**: Automatic failover mechanisms for high availability.
5. **Asynchronous Updates**: Process non-critical tasks asynchronously.
6. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent excessive API calls during flash sales.

---

### **Scalability Requirements**
- **50 Million active users**
- **5 Million orders**, ~15-20 Million writes.
- **500 Million reads** over 3 hours (~10 reads/user).

---

### **Suggested Technology Stack**
- **Distributed Locking**: Redis with Redlock or Zookeeper.
- **Database**: Sharded PostgreSQL, Read Replicas, or Cassandra.
- **Queuing**: Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- **Caching**: Redis, CDN.
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX, HAProxy.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience4j, Netflix Hystrix.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Implement **priority-based queues** for high-value customers.
- Introduce **machine learning** for demand prediction and real-time inventory adjustments.
- Utilize **auto-scaling Kubernetes clusters** to handle unpredictable traffic spikes.

This concise HLD provides a strong foundation for building a scalable, resilient, and high-performing flash sale system capable of handling millions of concurrent users.
