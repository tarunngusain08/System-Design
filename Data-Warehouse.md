## **1. Introduction**

The goal of this design is to build a robust, scalable, and efficient data warehouse for:
- Storing structured data from various sources.
- Supporting historical trend analysis and forecasting.
- Enabling complex analytical queries and real-time monitoring.

---

## **2. Architecture Overview**

### **High-Level Design**

1. **Data Sources**: OLTP databases, APIs, and external sources.
2. **Ingestion**: Real-time streaming with Kafka.
3. **Transformation**: Low-latency and batch processing using Flink and Spark.
4. **Storage**: Intermediate data stored in object storage; transformed data stored in a data lake.
5. **Querying**: Query engines access the data lake for analytics.

### **Workflow**
1. Data is extracted via Change Data Capture (CDC), APIs, or external sources.
2. Kafka acts as the message broker for all real-time data streams.
3. Flink and Spark transform and prepare the data.
4. Transformed data is stored in object storage and later moved to the data lake via orchestrated workflows.
5. Analysts and applications query the data lake through a query engine.

## **3. Layer Descriptions**

### **Extraction Layer**
- **Purpose**: Collect data from various sources and publish it to Kafka.
- **Components**:
  1. **Debezium**: Captures changes from OLTP databases (CDC).
  2. **APIs**: Push data directly into Kafka topics.
  3. **External Sources**: Use Kafka Connect for file-based ingestion.

### **Transformation Layer**
- **Purpose**: Process raw data for storage and analysis.
- **Components**:
  1. **Apache Flink**:
     - Real-time data processing and low-latency transformations.
     - Example: Aggregating user activity data by the hour.
  2. **Apache Spark**:
     - Batch processing for complex transformations.
     - Example: Cleaning and standardizing daily sales data.

### **Storage Layer**
- **Purpose**: Temporarily store and stage data before loading it into the data lake.
- **Components**:
  - Distributed Object Storage: MinIO, HDFS, or S3-compatible storage.
  - Data Formats: Parquet, Avro, JSON, images, PDFs.

### **Loading Layer**
- **Purpose**: Move processed data into the data lake.
- **Components**:
  1. **Cloud Functions**:
     - Triggered by Flink or Spark to orchestrate loading workflows.
  2. **Apache Airflow**:
     - Manages ETL pipelines and ensures data consistency during loading.
  3. **Data Lake**:
     - Stores structured and semi-structured data for querying.
     - Supports formats like Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake.

### **Query/Analytics Layer**
- **Purpose**: Provide insights through complex analytical queries.
- **Components**:
  - **Query Engine**: Presto, Trino, or Dremio.
  - **Consumers**: Analysts, dashboards, and reporting tools access the data lake.

## **4. Key Features**

1. **Scalability**: Kafka, Flink, and Spark ensure high-throughput data processing.
2. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Kafka DLQs handle unprocessable messages.
   - Airflow ensures idempotent ETL jobs.
3. **Real-Time Metrics**: Monitor ingestion and query performance.
4. **Concurrency**: Supports 10-20 concurrent users and queries.
5. **Data Retention**:
   - 5 years of active storage.
   - Archive older data to cold storage.

---

## **5. Scalability and Fault Tolerance**

### **Kafka**:
- Topics are partitioned for even load distribution.
- Replication ensures message durability.

### **Flink/Spark**:
- Parallel execution for high throughput.
- Checkpoints and retries for fault tolerance.

### **Data Lake**:
- Multi-zone/region replication for disaster recovery.
- Query performance optimized with partitioning and columnar storage formats.

---

## **6. Monitoring and Observability**

1. **Prometheus + Grafana**:
   - Kafka broker metrics: Consumer lag, throughput.
   - Flink/Spark job metrics: Latency, errors.
   - Airflow DAG status.

2. **Logging**:
   - Centralized log management with ELK stack or Fluentd.
   - Track errors and debug ETL pipelines.

3. **Alerting**:
   - Threshold-based alerts for Kafka lags, pipeline failures, and storage limits.
