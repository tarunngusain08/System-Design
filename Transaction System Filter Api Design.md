# Filter on Transaction System

Design a system for filtering transactions based on various criteria such as customer ID, start and end duration, etc., we can follow a layered architecture comprising multiple components. Below is a discussion of the Low-Level Design (LLD) for such a system:

## Components:
 
1. **API Layer**:
   - Responsible for handling incoming requests from users and delegating them to the appropriate components.
   - Exposes RESTful endpoints for clients to query transactions based on specified criteria.

2. **Query Service**:
   - Receives requests from the API layer and constructs database queries based on the provided parameters.
   - Implements logic for filtering transactions based on customer ID, start and end duration, etc.
   - Utilizes the Database Access Layer to interact with the database.

3. **Database Access Layer**:
   - Abstracts the interaction with the underlying database.
   - Provides methods for executing database queries, fetching transaction data, and mapping results to domain objects.

4. **Database**:
   - Stores transaction data in a structured format.
   - Supports efficient querying and indexing to facilitate fast retrieval of transactions based on various criteria.

## Detailed Design:

1. **API Layer**:
   - Exposes the following endpoints:
     - `/transactions`: GET endpoint to retrieve filtered transactions.
       - Accepts parameters such as `customer_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, etc.
       - For example: `/transactions?customer_id=123&start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-01-31`

2. **Query Service**:
   - Receives requests from the API layer and validates input parameters.
   - Constructs SQL queries dynamically based on the provided parameters.
   - Implements logic to handle different filtering criteria, such as:
     - Filtering by customer ID.
     - Filtering by transaction date range.
     - Additional criteria as required.
   - Executes the constructed SQL queries using the Database Access Layer.

3. **Database Access Layer**:
   - Provides methods to interact with the database, including:
     - Executing SQL queries.
     - Fetching transaction data from the database.
     - Mapping database results to domain objects (e.g., Transaction model).
   - Utilizes database connection pooling for efficient resource utilization.
   - Implements error handling and retry mechanisms for robustness.

4. **Database**:
   - Stores transaction data in tables designed to support efficient querying based on various criteria.
   - Tables may include:
     - `transactions`: Contains transaction records with attributes such as `transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `transaction_date`, `amount`, etc.
     - Additional tables for related entities (e.g., customers, products) if necessary.
   - Indexes are created on columns frequently used for filtering (e.g., `customer_id`, `transaction_date`) to optimize query performance.

## Scalability and Performance Considerations:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Deploy multiple instances of the Query Service behind a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly and handle increased traffic.
   - Utilize database replication and sharding techniques to distribute the database workload across multiple nodes and scale horizontally.

2. **Caching**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms at the API layer to cache frequently requested transactions and reduce the load on the database.
   - Use an in-memory data store (e.g., Redis) for caching to achieve low-latency access to cached data.

3. **Query Optimization**:
   - Profile and optimize database queries to ensure efficient execution plans.
   - Monitor database performance metrics and apply tuning techniques (e.g., index optimization, query rewriting) to improve query performance.

4. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Use asynchronous processing for non-real-time queries or tasks that can be deferred.
   - Implement background jobs or queues to process resource-intensive tasks asynchronously and improve overall system responsiveness.
